Have you ever felt like it's weird how a player unlocks abilities? Unless you're playing Matrix, where you download the ability to fly a helicopter, this approach makes no sense.

And this is exactly the problem that is solved with the Taiken system.

It's a lot about bringing logic **and** common sense together into the world of pen and paper.

This is a basic system that you can customize for your needs. It would be great if you could share your personal version [here](https://github.com/Custom-Tabletop-RPG/taiken/discussions/categories/show-and-tell) so that others can benefit from your experience.
